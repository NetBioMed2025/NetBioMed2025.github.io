      <p>
        NetBioMed is a satellite that was conceived in 2020 by combining the strengths of two previous highly successful satellites, NetMed and NetSciReg, which ran at NetSci from 2013 to 2019. NetBioMed is dedicated to the integrated fields of Network Science, Biology, and Medicine, and has been well-attended by a wide audience of scientists at NetSci every year since 2020.
      </p>

      <p>
        Network science has an established record of being successfully applied to gain key scientific insights into biological systems and to provide compelling biomedical and clinical hypotheses. Tools from network science are used broadly in biology and medicine. In this satellite we will explore the role of network medicine across different scales, from molecular relationships to individual patient treatments.
      </p>

      <p>
        This satellite aims to bring together network scientists whose research focuses on biomedical applications and biomedical scientists who are interested in learning about how network approaches can be used to study biological or disease systems. Based on NetBioMed's reception and an enthusiastic audience over the past years, we anticipate a high level of interest in biomedical networks at NetSci, justifying this satellite symposium.
